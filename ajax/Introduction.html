<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Trees are fun. Often trees can disguise their wonder. Even basic  research can show how these plants are at least as fascinating as the  extroverted animal kingdom. This key was made to help kindle interest in trees and  be the beginnings of an education into their intriguing world. </p>
  <p>This key is by no means an exhaustive list of the trees of the British Isles, but more of an overview of the more common  trees likely to be seen in the wild. The key is designed for use by people with  some botanical knowledge, but it is still navigable by those without using the  glossary (and patience). Trees grown  in cultivation can be identified, however, their morphology may be different so  identification may be harder. With these aspects in mind, plenty of fun can be  had out in the field identifying trees to your hearts content and realising  your botanical potential! </p>
  <p>This key was made using Bentham and Hooker&rsquo;s <em>Handbook of British Flora </em>and the accompanying book of illustrations<em>. </em>Bentham first published this key in 1858  with the aim to enable people with no prior botanical knowledge to &ldquo;name the  wild flowers they may gather on their country rambles&rdquo; (Bentham and Hooker,  1943), and was Bentham&rsquo;s most famous work. It forms the basis for this key as it  is a classic key that has been used by students for over a century  running into many editions, it is now out of print. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The wonder is that we can see these trees and not  wonder more</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson - 19th  century American poet</p>
